0.  Python. 
    Of course you need to install python since it uses a python framework--web.py

1.  MySQL
    Because it uses mysql as database.

2.  python-mysqldb
    sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb

2.5 REMEMBER TO import the sql file "twitter_cube.sql" into your MySQL database.

3.  web.py
    A lightweight python framework.

4.  tweepy
    A Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
    just git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
    And then install tweepy. (may need super premission)

5.  Last step is to put current files or directories or whatever into /var/www/twittercube
    /**********IMPORTANT,  REMEMBER TO "sudo chmod 777 twittercube/"  and some files also need 777 permission ********/
    And if you want to see how it works in the debug mode, just enter into that direcory and
    type "python code.py" in the terminal, then you can check the website in "http://localhost:8080"
