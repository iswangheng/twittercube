Functionality:

1. Startup:
   Lid loads all *.dat files in the current directory, assuming that
   the files contain the tri-gram model of the language which is named
   with the file name (e.g. japanese.dat, german.dat etc.).

2. Processing:
	Lid processes all the files given as parameters to the script and prints
	out the language of the text that the file contains.

Lid can be used within an application by importing the class and using its
methods as shown in the end of this code (the __main__ part):

myLid = Lid()
languagename = myLid("This is an English example.")


Basics:

	Lid is based on a tri-gram model of a training corpus for a given language.
	Use lidtrainer.py to generate such language models.

	The language models are sets of three character sequences (tri-grams) extracted
	from the training corpus, with their frequency. The probability of each
	tri-gram is calculated (given the frequency of the tri-gram and the number
	of all tri-grams in the corpus) and stored with the tri-gram in the language
	model.

	Lid generates all tri-grams for the test document and compares the probability
	of each tri-gram with the probabilities the corresponding tri-grams in the
	training corpus or the language model. For each tri-gram the deviation from
	the corresponding tri-gram in the language model is calculated. If a tri-gram is
	not found in the language model, the deviation is assumed to be maximal, i.e.
	equal to 1.

	The language model that has the minimal deviation score for the tri-grams in
	the tested text is assumed to represent the language of the tested text.

	This is a very simple but effective language ID strategy. It is developed for
	teaching purposes. A real world application would require much more evaluation
	of the significance of the deviations, optimization of the language models and
	many many other things.
